/**
 * Reflection mecanisms do not allow us to find all the classes implemented in a
 * given package, or extending a given class. The classes can not register
 * themselve statically as they will not be loaded unless they are needed.
 * Another solution would have been to check the Games/Nim/Players directory for
 * classes and to determine them using their name, but this seems unsafe and
 * daunty. The solution we use is merely to store the classes in a list. Not
 * very elegant but functional and easy.
 * 
 * Note that the terminal launcher does not need this as the classes are given
 * as textual command-line arguments.
